      # E2E tests commented out temporarily - require Cloudflare preview deployment
      # TODO: Set up Cloudflare Workers preview deployment for E2E tests
      # This requires:
      # 1. Cloudflare API token and account setup
      # 2. Deploy to preview environment
      # 3. Run E2E tests against preview URL
      # 4. Clean up preview deployment
      #
      # For now, rely on:
      # - Unit tests (325 passing)
      # - Local manual E2E testing
      # - Post-merge deployment verification
