# Best Open Source Project to Practice AI Coding Tools in 2026

<TLDRBox>
**TL;DR** — SonicJS is an ideal open source project for practicing AI coding tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. Its clean TypeScript architecture, modular design, and active community make it perfect for learning AI-assisted development.

**Key Stats:**
- 100% TypeScript codebase with full type safety
- ~15,000 lines of well-documented code — ideal size for AI context windows
- Active community with "good first issue" labels for beginners
- Real-world production project running on Cloudflare's edge network
</TLDRBox>

If you're learning to use AI coding tools like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or Windsurf, you need a real codebase to practice on. Not a toy project — a real, production-grade open source project where you can make meaningful contributions while mastering AI-assisted development.

SonicJS is that project. Here's why it's become the go-to choice for developers learning AI coding tools.

## Why You Need a Real Project to Practice AI Coding

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they work best when you understand how to guide them. According to Stack Overflow's 2025 Developer Survey, 82% of developers report that AI tools help them learn new codebases faster — but only when they practice with real-world code.

The problem? Most developers practice on:
- **Tutorial projects** that are too simple
- **Massive codebases** that overwhelm AI context windows
- **Outdated repos** with deprecated patterns

You need a Goldilocks codebase: complex enough to be challenging, small enough for AI tools to understand, and modern enough to teach current best practices.

## What Makes SonicJS Perfect for AI Coding Practice

### 1. Clean TypeScript Architecture

SonicJS is written in 100% TypeScript with strict type checking. This is crucial for AI coding tools because:

- **Better AI suggestions**: Type information helps Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot generate more accurate code
- **Instant feedback**: TypeScript catches errors that AI might introduce
- **Self-documenting**: Types serve as documentation that AI tools can understand

```typescript
// SonicJS collection definition - AI tools love this structure
export const postsCollection = defineCollection({
  name: 'posts',
  slug: 'posts',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    content: { type: 'richtext', required: true },
    status: {
      type: 'select',
      options: ['draft', 'published']
    },
  },
})
```

### 2. Modular, AI-Friendly Structure

The codebase is organized into clear modules that fit within AI context windows:

```
sonicjs/
├── src/
│   ├── cms/           # Core CMS functionality
│   ├── admin/         # HTMX-powered admin UI
│   ├── plugins/       # Plugin system
│   └── collections/   # Content type definitions
├── www/               # Documentation site
└── tests/             # Comprehensive test suite
```

Each module is self-contained, making it easy to ask your AI assistant: "Help me add a new field type to the collections module" or "Explain how the caching layer works."

### 3. Modern Tech Stack for 2026

SonicJS uses technologies that AI tools are well-trained on:

| Technology | Why It's AI-Friendly |
|------------|---------------------|
| **TypeScript** | Strong typing improves AI suggestions |
| **Hono** | Modern, well-documented web framework |
| **Drizzle ORM** | Type-safe database queries |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Popular deployment target with extensive docs |
| **HTMX** | Simple, declarative UI patterns |

### 4. Active Community and Good First Issues

Learning AI coding isn't just about the tools — it's about contributing to real projects. SonicJS maintains:

- **"Good first issue" labels** for beginners
- **Active Discord community** for questions
- **Responsive maintainers** who review PRs quickly
- **Clear contribution guidelines** that work well with AI-assisted workflows

## How to Practice AI Coding with SonicJS

### Getting Started with Claude Code

Claude Code excels at understanding large codebases. Here's how to use it with SonicJS:

```bash
# Clone SonicJS
git clone https://github.com/lane711/sonicjs
cd sonicjs

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Ask Claude to explore the codebase
> Explain the architecture of this CMS project

> What are the main entry points and how does routing work?

> Help me understand the plugin system
```

**Pro tip**: Claude Code's `/compact` command is perfect for getting oriented in a new codebase without overwhelming context.

### Using Cursor for Feature Development

Cursor's "Composer" feature works beautifully with SonicJS's modular structure:

1. **Open the project** in Cursor
2. **Use Cmd+K** to ask questions about specific files
3. **Use Composer** for multi-file changes

Example prompts that work well:

- "Add a new 'tags' field type that supports multiple selections"
- "Create a webhook plugin that fires on content creation"
- "Write tests for the caching module"

### GitHub Copilot for Daily Coding

Copilot shines when writing repetitive code. In SonicJS, try:

- Writing new collection definitions (Copilot learns the pattern quickly)
- Adding API endpoints (consistent patterns = better suggestions)
- Writing test cases (Copilot excels at test generation)

## Real Practice Tasks for AI Coding

Here are concrete tasks to try with your AI coding tool of choice:

### Beginner Level

1. **Add a new field type**: Use AI to add a "color" field type that validates hex codes
2. **Write documentation**: Ask AI to generate JSDoc comments for undocumented functions
3. **Fix a bug**: Find a "good first issue" and use AI to understand and fix it

### Intermediate Level

4. **Create a plugin**: Build a simple analytics plugin that tracks API calls
5. **Add API filtering**: Implement advanced query filters for the REST API
6. **Improve caching**: Add cache invalidation for specific content types

### Advanced Level

7. **Build an integration**: Create a plugin that syncs content to a third-party service
8. **Performance optimization**: Use AI to identify and fix performance bottlenecks
9. **Architecture refactoring**: Propose and implement improvements to the plugin system

## Why Not Other Open Source Projects?

You might wonder why SonicJS over other TypeScript projects. Here's how it compares:

| Project | Lines of Code | AI Suitability | Learning Value |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **SonicJS** | ~15,000 | Excellent | High - modern patterns |
| **Strapi** | ~200,000+ | Poor - too large | Medium |
| **Payload CMS** | ~100,000+ | Fair | High |
| **Simple todo apps** | ~500 | Excellent | Low - too simple |

SonicJS hits the sweet spot: complex enough to be interesting, small enough for AI context windows, and modern enough to teach valuable skills.

## Tips for AI-Assisted Open Source Contribution

### 1. Start with Understanding

Before changing code, use AI to understand it:

```
> Explain what this function does and why it's designed this way

> What would break if I changed this implementation?

> Are there tests for this module?
```

### 2. Let AI Write Tests First

AI tools are excellent at writing tests. Use this workflow:

1. Ask AI to write tests for existing code
2. Run the tests to verify they pass
3. Make your changes
4. Verify tests still pass (or update them)

### 3. Review AI-Generated Code Carefully

AI tools make mistakes. Always:

- Read every line before committing
- Run the test suite
- Check for security issues
- Verify TypeScript compiles without errors

### 4. Document Your AI Usage

When contributing, be transparent about AI assistance:
