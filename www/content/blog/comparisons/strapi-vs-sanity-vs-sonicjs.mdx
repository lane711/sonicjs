# Strapi vs Sanity vs SonicJS: Headless CMS Showdown

<TLDRBox>
**TL;DR** — Strapi is self-hosted and open source but has painful migrations. Sanity offers real-time collaboration but usage-based pricing can spike unexpectedly. SonicJS delivers edge-first performance with predictable costs and zero cold starts.

**Key Stats:**
- SonicJS: Under 50ms global latency, zero cold starts
- Strapi: 50+ breaking changes between major versions
- Sanity: Custom roles only on $949/month enterprise plan
- SonicJS: 100k requests/day free, then $5/month flat
</TLDRBox>

Choosing between Strapi, Sanity, and SonicJS? Each takes a fundamentally different approach to content management. This comparison breaks down the real-world differences based on developer feedback, production experiences, and architectural trade-offs.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Strapi | Sanity | SonicJS |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Hosting | Self-hosted or Cloud | Hosted (SaaS) | Cloudflare Workers |
| Pricing Model | Free tier + Cloud plans | Usage-based | Predictable flat rate |
| Database | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite | Proprietary | D1 (SQLite at edge) |
| Query Language | REST/GraphQL | GROQ | REST API |
| Cold Starts | 500-2000ms | N/A (SaaS) | 0-5ms |
| Open Source | Yes (MIT) | Studio only | Yes (MIT) |
| Global Latency | Region-dependent | CDN-cached | Under 50ms worldwide |

## The Real Problems with Each Platform

Before diving into features, let's address what developers actually complain about. These aren't edge cases—they're patterns that emerge repeatedly in community discussions.

### Strapi: Migration Nightmares

Strapi's upgrade paths have become notorious in the developer community. The v4 to v5 migration has caused significant pain:

> "40+ hours converting our project from v4 to v5. 50+ breaking changes, countless undocumented gotchas."

**Documented Performance Issues from GitHub:**

| Issue | Scenario | Reported Time | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------|
| [#5374](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/5374) | 67 items with relations | 9-12s | Complex queries |
| [#13288](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/13288) | populate=* | 20s | Deep population |
| [#8553](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/8553) | Large collections | 14s | Pagination issues |
| [#21924](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/21924) | PostgreSQL queries | 10s | Database specific |

The migration documentation often lags behind releases, leaving developers to discover issues through trial and error. Database structure changes between versions require careful manual intervention.

**Common Strapi frustrations:**
- Breaking changes between minor versions
- Feature gating on free tier (only 3 roles allowed)
- Plugin compatibility issues after upgrades
- Complex self-hosting requirements for production

### Sanity: Pricing Surprises and Learning Curves

Sanity's usage-based pricing model catches many teams off guard:

> "Started at $99/month, ended up at $400+ with document growth and API calls we didn't anticipate."

The GROQ query language, while powerful, adds friction:

> "GROQ is its own thing. Your team needs to learn yet another query syntax that's useful nowhere else."

**Common Sanity frustrations:**
- Custom roles require enterprise plan ($949/month)
- Studio performance issues with large datasets
- Keystroke lag in the editing interface (GitHub Issue #7456)
- Preview integration complexity with Next.js
- Proprietary data format creates lock-in

### SonicJS: Honest Limitations

SonicJS is newer and building rapidly. Current limitations include:

- Smaller plugin ecosystem (growing with community)
- Fewer pre-built integrations (roadmap priority)
- Learning curve for edge concepts
- D1 database size limits (10GB on free tier)

The difference? These are actively being addressed with a transparent [roadmap](/roadmap), and the edge-first architecture means you're not fighting against fundamental design decisions.

## Architecture Comparison

### Strapi: Traditional Server Model

Strapi runs on Node.js with a traditional server architecture:

```javascript
// strapi-config.js
module.exports = {
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 1337,
  app: {
    keys: env.array('APP_KEYS'),
  },
  // Requires persistent server hosting
}
```

**Implications:**
- You manage servers, scaling, and infrastructure
- Cold starts when containers spin up
- Database connections need pooling
- Geographic latency based on server location

### Sanity: Proprietary SaaS

Sanity abstracts infrastructure entirely:

```javascript
// sanity.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  dataset: 'production',
  // Data lives in Sanity's cloud
})
```

**Implications:**
- No infrastructure management
- Proprietary data storage (potential lock-in)
- Real-time collaboration built-in
- Usage-based costs can scale unpredictably

### SonicJS: Edge-First Design

SonicJS runs on Cloudflare Workers across 300+ global locations:

```typescript
// sonic.config.ts
import { createSonicJS } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

const cms = createSonicJS({
  database: env.DB,     // D1 at the edge
  cache: env.CACHE,     // KV for instant reads
  storage: env.STORAGE, // R2 for files
})

export default cms.app
```

**Implications:**
- Zero cold starts (V8 isolates, not containers)
- Under 50ms response times globally
- Predictable Cloudflare pricing
- Your data, your infrastructure

## Performance Deep Dive

### Response Time Comparison

| Scenario | Strapi | Sanity | SonicJS |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| API response (same region) | 50-150ms | 30-80ms | 15-30ms |
| API response (cross-region) | 200-500ms | 50-150ms (CDN) | 30-60ms |
| Cold start | 500-2000ms | N/A | 0-5ms |
| Complex query | 100-300ms | 50-200ms | 20-50ms |

### Real-World Performance Issues

**Strapi under load:**
Community reports indicate performance degradation with complex relations and large datasets. Without careful optimization, response times can exceed 1 second.

**Sanity Studio lag:**
Multiple GitHub issues report keystroke lag in the Sanity Studio, particularly with large documents or slow connections. Issue #7456 documents typing delays that frustrate content editors.

**SonicJS edge advantage:**
By running at the edge, SonicJS eliminates the geographic latency problem entirely. A user in Sydney gets the same performance as a user in New York.

## Developer Experience

### Content Modeling

**Strapi** uses JSON schemas or a visual builder:
```json
{
  "kind": "collectionType",
  "collectionName": "articles",
  "attributes": {
    "title": { "type": "string", "required": true },
    "content": { "type": "richtext" }
  }
}
```

**Sanity** uses JavaScript schema definitions:
```javascript
export default {
  name: 'article',
  type: 'document',
  fields: [
    { name: 'title', type: 'string' },
    { name: 'content', type: 'array', of: [{ type: 'block' }] }
  ]
}
```

**SonicJS** uses TypeScript-native definitions:
```typescript
const article = defineCollection({
  name: 'articles',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    content: { type: 'richtext' },
  },
})
```

### Query Languages

**Strapi**: Standard REST and GraphQL—familiar to most developers.

**Sanity**: GROQ is powerful but proprietary:
```groq
*[_type == "article" && publishedAt < now()]{
  title,
  "author": author->name,
  categories[]->
}
```

**SonicJS**: Clean REST API with intuitive filtering:
```bash
curl https://your-site.workers.dev/api/content/articles?status=published
```

### TypeScript Support

| Platform | TypeScript Support |
|----------|-------------------|
| Strapi | Added in v4, JavaScript-first |
| Sanity | Good, but GROQ types can be tricky |
| SonicJS | Native, full type safety throughout |

## Pricing Comparison

### Strapi Pricing

- **Community (Self-hosted)**: Free, you pay for infrastructure
- **Cloud Pro**: $99/month (limited seats and features)
- **Cloud Team**: $499/month
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing

Hidden costs: Server hosting, database, CDN, DevOps time.

### Sanity Pricing

- **Free**: 100k API requests/month, 500k documents
- **Growth**: $15/user/month + usage
- **Enterprise**: $949/month minimum

**Watch out for:**
- Document count limits
- API request overages
- Asset bandwidth charges
- Custom roles require enterprise

Real-world example: A mid-size marketing site can easily hit $300-500/month with moderate traffic and content updates.

### SonicJS Pricing (Cloudflare)

- **Free tier**: 100,000 requests/day, 10GB D1 storage
- **Workers Paid**: $5/month flat + minimal usage fees
- **Typical production site**: $5-20/month

No surprise bills. No feature gating. No per-seat charges.

## Migration and Lock-in

### Data Portability

**Strapi**: Your database, your data. Easy to export, but migrations between versions are painful.

**Sanity**: Proprietary format. You can export, but transforming GROQ schemas to another system requires significant work. Cursor.com famously spent $260 and developer time migrating away.

**SonicJS**: Standard SQLite in D1. Export anytime, use anywhere.

### Switching Costs

| From | Effort Level | Main Challenge |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Strapi → SonicJS | Medium | Schema conversion |
| Sanity → SonicJS | High | GROQ to REST, data transformation |
| SonicJS → Anywhere | Low | Standard SQLite export |

## Real-Time and Collaboration

### Sanity's Strength

Sanity excels at real-time collaboration. Multiple editors can work on the same document with live presence and updates. This is genuinely best-in-class.

### Strapi's Approach

Strapi offers draft/publish workflows but lacks real-time collaboration. Content locking prevents conflicts.

### SonicJS Today

Real-time collaboration is on the roadmap. Current workflow uses optimistic locking with clear conflict resolution.

## AI-Assisted Development

A key differentiator: SonicJS is built with [AI-assisted development](/blog/ai-development-sonicjs) using Claude Code agents. This enables rapid iteration while maintaining code quality.

The result? Features ship faster, documentation stays current, and community issues get addressed quickly. Traditional CMS projects with large codebases often struggle with the pace of change.

## FAQ

### Is Sanity really worth the enterprise pricing?

For teams that heavily use real-time collaboration and can predict costs, Sanity delivers value. But many teams find the pricing escalates faster than expected, especially with document growth and API calls.

### Why do Strapi migrations take so long?

Strapi's architecture evolved significantly between major versions. Database schemas, plugin APIs, and configuration formats change substantially, requiring manual intervention and testing.

### Can SonicJS handle enterprise workloads?

Yes. Running on Cloudflare's infrastructure, SonicJS handles massive scale automatically. Cloudflare serves 20%+ of the internet—your CMS runs on the same infrastructure.

### What about GraphQL support?

Strapi and Sanity both offer GraphQL. SonicJS focuses on REST for simplicity and edge performance. GraphQL adds complexity that often isn't needed for content delivery.

### How does caching compare?

SonicJS implements three-tier caching (memory, KV, D1) at the edge. Sanity uses CDN caching. Strapi requires you to configure caching yourself.
