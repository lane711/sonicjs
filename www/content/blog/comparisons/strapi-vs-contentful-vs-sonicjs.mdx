# Strapi vs Contentful vs SonicJS: Self-Hosted vs SaaS vs Edge

<TLDRBox>
**TL;DR** — Strapi is self-hosted and open source but has painful migrations. Contentful is enterprise SaaS with pricing that starts at $60k/year for premium. SonicJS is edge-first with sub-50ms global latency and predictable $5-20/month costs.

**Key Stats:**
- Strapi: 50+ breaking changes between v4→v5
- Contentful: 45% of users report slow performance during peak usage
- SonicJS: Under 50ms globally, zero cold starts
- Contentful Premium: $60,000/year list price
</TLDRBox>

Strapi and Contentful represent two ends of the headless CMS spectrum: self-hosted open source vs managed enterprise SaaS. SonicJS offers a third path: edge-first architecture with the benefits of both.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Strapi | Contentful | SonicJS |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|
| Hosting Model | Self-hosted | Cloud SaaS | Edge (Cloudflare Workers) |
| Pricing | Free + cloud options | $60k+/year enterprise | $5-20/month typical |
| Database | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite | Proprietary | D1 (SQLite at edge) |
| Data Ownership | Full | Contentful-controlled | Full |
| Cold starts | 500-2000ms | N/A (SaaS) | 0-5ms |
| Global latency | 200-500ms | Varies (CDN-cached) | Under 50ms |
| Content Types Limit | Unlimited | Limited on lower tiers | Unlimited |
| Open Source | Yes (MIT) | No | Yes (MIT) |
| GraphQL | Plugin | Yes | Roadmap |

## The Real Problems

### Strapi: Migration Hell

Strapi's major version upgrades have become notorious:

> "40+ hours converting our project from v4 to v5. 50+ breaking changes, countless undocumented gotchas."

**Common Strapi frustrations:**
- Breaking changes between versions
- Limited to 3 roles on free tier
- Plugin compatibility breaks on upgrades
- Self-hosting complexity in production

### Contentful: Enterprise Pricing, Enterprise Problems

Contentful's costs catch teams off guard:

> "Premium starts at $60,000/year. Space add-ons can reach $75,000+ each."

**Common Contentful frustrations:**
- 45% of users report slow performance during peak usage
- Content type limits on non-enterprise plans
- No true relational models (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Heavy developer dependency—non-technical users struggle
- Publishing affects all environments simultaneously
- 40% faced integration challenges due to API limitations

Real user feedback on content limits:
> "If you wish to port an existing design system 1:1 and don't have the enterprise plan, you'll quickly run out of components. The development team had to prioritize which content types were critical—this frustrated both developers and the content team."

### SonicJS: Honest Limitations

SonicJS is newer and building rapidly:

- Smaller plugin ecosystem (growing)
- D1 database only (edge-native design)
- GraphQL on roadmap
- Fewer enterprise integrations currently

## Architecture Comparison

### Strapi: Traditional Self-Hosted

You own and manage everything:

```javascript
// Strapi requires a server
module.exports = {
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 1337,
  app: { keys: env.array('APP_KEYS') },
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Server provisioning and scaling
- Database management
- Security updates
- Backup strategies
- CDN configuration

### Contentful: Managed SaaS

Everything managed, but at a cost:

```javascript
// Contentful configuration
const client = createClient({
  space: 'your_space_id',
  accessToken: 'your_access_token',
})
```

**Trade-offs:**
- No infrastructure management
- Proprietary data storage
- Vendor lock-in
- Premium pricing

### SonicJS: Edge-First

Best of both worlds:

```typescript
// SonicJS on Cloudflare Workers
import { createSonicJS } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

const cms = createSonicJS({
  database: env.DB,
  cache: env.CACHE,
  storage: env.STORAGE,
})

export default cms.app
```

**Benefits:**
- No server management
- Your data, your control
- Global distribution automatic
- Predictable pricing

## Performance Comparison

| Scenario | Strapi | Contentful | SonicJS |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| API response (same region) | 50-150ms | 30-100ms | 15-30ms |
| API response (cross-region) | 200-500ms | 50-150ms (CDN) | 30-60ms |
| Cold start | 500-2000ms | N/A | 0-5ms |
| Peak traffic performance | Degrades without scaling | Reported slowdowns (45%) | Consistent |

### The Edge Advantage

Strapi and Contentful serve from centralized locations. Even with Contentful's CDN, dynamic API calls still hit origin servers.

SonicJS runs your entire CMS at the edge:

```
Request → Nearest Edge Location → Response
         (300+ locations globally)
```

No origin round-trips for API calls. Consistent under 50ms worldwide.

## Content Modeling

### Strapi

Code or visual builder, flexible but versions can break schemas:

```javascript
// strapi content type
{
  "kind": "collectionType",
  "attributes": {
    "title": { "type": "string", "required": true },
    "content": { "type": "richtext" }
  }
}
```

### Contentful

Visual editor primarily, JSON schema under the hood:

**Limitations:**
- No true relational models
- Content type limits on lower tiers
- Complex localization requires workarounds

### SonicJS

TypeScript-native, full type safety:

```typescript
const posts = defineCollection({
  name: 'posts',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    content: { type: 'richtext' },
    author: { type: 'relation', collection: 'users' },
  },
})
```

## Data Ownership & Lock-in

### Strapi: Full Ownership
- Your database, your data
- Export anytime
- Migration between versions is the challenge

### Contentful: Vendor Lock-in
- Proprietary data format
- Export available but transformation required
- Content type limits create artificial constraints
- Significant migration effort to leave

### SonicJS: Full Ownership
- Standard SQLite in D1
- Export anytime
- No proprietary formats

## When to Choose Each

### Choose Strapi If:

- You have DevOps capacity
- Full infrastructure control is required
- You're okay managing migrations
- Budget constraints favor self-hosting

### Choose Contentful If:

- Enterprise budget is available ($60k+/year)
- No infrastructure team available
- Extensive third-party integrations needed
- Enterprise compliance requirements

### Choose SonicJS If:

- Global performance is critical
- Budget is under $100/month
- You want data ownership without DevOps
- Edge-first architecture appeals to you

## FAQ

### Is Contentful worth the enterprise pricing?

For large enterprises with compliance requirements and existing Contentful expertise, possibly. For most teams, the pricing is difficult to justify when alternatives exist.

### Why are Strapi migrations so painful?

Strapi's architecture has evolved significantly between major versions. Database schemas and plugin APIs change substantially, requiring manual intervention.

### Can SonicJS match Contentful's features?

Core CMS features, yes. Contentful has more enterprise integrations currently. SonicJS offers edge performance that Contentful can't match.

### What about localization?

- Strapi: Built-in localization
- Contentful: Basic localization, no workflow features
- SonicJS: Localization support with flexible implementation

## Conclusion

Three philosophies:

- **Strapi**: Maximum control with operational overhead
- **Contentful**: Enterprise convenience at enterprise prices
- **SonicJS**: Edge-first performance with modern simplicity

For teams wanting performance, data ownership, and predictable costs, SonicJS offers a compelling alternative to both extremes.

## Key Takeaways

- Strapi's v4→v5 migration required 40+ hours for some teams
- Contentful Premium starts at $60,000/year
- 45% of Contentful users report peak-time performance issues
- SonicJS delivers under 50ms global latency for $5-20/month
- Edge-first architecture eliminates the self-host vs SaaS trade-off
