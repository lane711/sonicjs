# Sanity vs Contentful vs SonicJS: Premium CMS Showdown

<TLDRBox>
**TL;DR** — Sanity offers best-in-class real-time collaboration but usage-based pricing surprises teams. Contentful is enterprise-focused with $60k+/year pricing. SonicJS delivers edge-first performance with predictable costs under $20/month.

**Key Stats:**
- Sanity: Custom roles require $949/month enterprise plan
- Contentful: 45% of users report performance issues during peak usage
- SonicJS: Under 50ms globally, zero cold starts
- Both Sanity & Contentful: Usage-based pricing with escalating costs
</TLDRBox>

Sanity and Contentful are two leading SaaS headless CMS platforms with overlapping enterprise focus but different strengths. SonicJS offers a fundamentally different approach with edge-first architecture.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Sanity | Contentful | SonicJS |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|
| Hosting | Cloud SaaS | Cloud SaaS | Edge (Cloudflare Workers) |
| Pricing Model | Usage-based | Tiered enterprise | Predictable flat rate |
| Real-time Collab | Best-in-class | Basic | Roadmap |
| Query Language | GROQ | REST/GraphQL | REST API |
| Data Storage | Proprietary | Proprietary | D1 (you own it) |
| Cold starts | N/A (SaaS) | N/A (SaaS) | 0-5ms |
| Global latency | CDN-cached | CDN-cached | Under 50ms (edge-native) |
| Custom Roles (free) | No | No | Yes |
| Open Source | Studio only | No | Yes (MIT) |

## The Real Problems

### Sanity: Pricing Surprises and Learning Curves

Sanity's usage-based model catches teams off guard:

> "Started at $99/month, ended up at $400+ with document growth and API calls we didn't anticipate."

**GROQ learning curve:**
> "GROQ is its own thing. Your team needs to learn yet another query syntax that's useful nowhere else."

**Common Sanity frustrations:**
- Custom roles require enterprise plan ($949/month)
- Studio keystroke lag with large documents (GitHub Issue #7456)
- Preview integration complexity with Next.js
- Proprietary data format creates lock-in
- Slow builds reported (10+ minutes)

Real-world example: Cursor.com famously spent $260 and developer time migrating away from Sanity to markdown files.

### Contentful: Enterprise Everything

Contentful is built for enterprise budgets:

> "Premium starts at $60,000/year. Space add-ons can reach $75,000+ each."

**Common Contentful frustrations:**
- 45% of users report slow performance during peak usage
- Content type limits on non-enterprise plans
- No true relational models
- Heavy developer dependency
- 40% faced integration challenges
- Publishing affects all environments at once

### SonicJS: Honest Limitations

SonicJS is newer and building rapidly:

- Real-time collaboration on roadmap (not shipped)
- Smaller plugin ecosystem
- D1 database only
- Fewer enterprise integrations currently

## Architecture Comparison

### Sanity: Real-Time First

Sanity's architecture prioritizes collaboration:

```javascript
// Sanity Studio configuration
export default defineConfig({
  projectId: 'your-project',
  dataset: 'production',
  schema: { types: schemaTypes },
})
```

**Strengths:**
- Multiple editors, same document, real-time
- Live presence indicators
- Instant sync across clients

**Trade-offs:**
- GROQ query language lock-in
- Proprietary data storage
- Usage-based pricing unpredictability

### Contentful: Enterprise SaaS

Enterprise-grade with enterprise complexity:

```javascript
const client = createClient({
  space: 'space_id',
  accessToken: 'access_token',
})
```

**Strengths:**
- Robust governance and workflows
- Extensive integration marketplace
- Enterprise compliance features

**Trade-offs:**
- Significant pricing
- Content type limitations
- Performance issues reported

### SonicJS: Edge-First

Runs globally on Cloudflare Workers:

```typescript
import { createSonicJS } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

const cms = createSonicJS({
  database: env.DB,
  cache: env.CACHE,
  storage: env.STORAGE,
})

export default cms.app
```

**Strengths:**
- Under 50ms response worldwide
- Zero cold starts
- Your data, full ownership
- Predictable pricing

## Performance Analysis

### Sanity

- Good performance via CDN caching
- Studio can lag with large documents
- Build times can extend to 10+ minutes
- GROQ queries optimized for their backend

### Contentful

- CDN-cached for reads
- 45% report peak-time slowdowns
- API rate limits can throttle high-volume apps
- Dynamic queries hit origin servers

### SonicJS

- Under 50ms globally (edge-native)
- Zero cold starts
- Three-tier caching (memory → KV → D1)
- Consistent performance regardless of load

**Key difference:** Sanity and Contentful cache content at the edge. SonicJS runs the entire CMS at the edge—no origin round-trips for API calls.

## Pricing Deep Dive

### Sanity Pricing

**Published tiers:**
- Free: 100k API requests/month, 500k documents
- Growth: $15/user/month + usage
- Enterprise: $949/month minimum

**Watch out for:**
- Document count limits
- API request overages
- Asset bandwidth charges
- Custom roles only on enterprise

**Real-world example:** A mid-size marketing site easily hits $300-500/month with moderate traffic.

### Contentful Pricing

**Enterprise tiers:**
- Premium: $60,000/year list
- Premium Plus: $140,000/year list
- Space add-ons: $8,000-75,000+ each

**Negotiated rates:**
- 40-45% discounts common on large deals
- Still $35,000-80,000/year typical

### SonicJS Pricing

**Cloudflare-based:**
- Free tier: 100,000 requests/day, 10GB D1
- Workers Paid: $5/month flat
- Typical production site: $5-20/month

**No surprises:**
- No per-seat charges
- No usage overages
- No feature gating

## Query Languages

### Sanity: GROQ

Powerful but proprietary:

```groq
*[_type == "post" && publishedAt < now()]{
  title,
  "author": author->name,
  categories[]->
}
```

**Pros:** Powerful, flexible
**Cons:** Learning curve, only useful in Sanity

### Contentful: REST/GraphQL

Standard approaches:

```graphql
query {
  postCollection {
    items {
      title
      author { name }
    }
  }
}
```

### SonicJS: REST API

Clean, intuitive:

```bash
curl https://your-site.workers.dev/api/content/posts?status=published
```

**Philosophy:** Standard patterns that transfer to any system.

## Real-Time Collaboration

### Sanity: Best-in-Class

Genuinely excellent real-time collaboration:
- Multiple editors, same document
- Live presence indicators
- Instant sync
- No conflict resolution needed

If real-time collaboration is your primary requirement, Sanity excels.

### Contentful: Basic

- Draft/publish workflow
- Content locking
- No real-time co-editing

### SonicJS: Roadmap

- Optimistic locking current
- Real-time collaboration planned
- Clear conflict resolution

## Data Ownership & Lock-in

### Sanity

- Proprietary data format
- GROQ creates query lock-in
- Export available but transformation required
- Cursor.com's migration cost: $260 + developer time

### Contentful

- Proprietary format
- Content type limits create artificial constraints
- Export requires significant transformation
- Space structure doesn't map to other systems

### SonicJS

- Standard SQLite in D1
- Export anytime
- No proprietary formats
- MIT licensed, truly open source

## When to Choose Each

### Choose Sanity If:

- Real-time collaboration is essential
- Budget can handle usage-based pricing
- Team can learn GROQ
- Lock-in is acceptable

### Choose Contentful If:

- Enterprise budget available ($60k+/year)
- Extensive compliance requirements
- Large integration ecosystem needed
- Enterprise governance essential

### Choose SonicJS If:

- Global performance is critical
- Predictable costs matter
- Data ownership is required
- Edge-first architecture appeals

## FAQ

### Is Sanity's real-time collaboration worth the pricing?

For content teams that heavily collaborate in real-time, yes. For API-first usage or solo content creators, probably not worth the complexity.

### Can SonicJS match Contentful's enterprise features?

Core CMS features, yes. Contentful has more compliance certifications and enterprise integrations. SonicJS offers edge performance neither can match.

### Why did Cursor.com leave Sanity?

They switched to markdown files for simplicity and control. Their experience highlighted the migration cost from proprietary platforms.

### What about preview functionality?

- Sanity: Powerful but complex to configure
- Contentful: Built-in preview environments
- SonicJS: Live preview with simple setup

## Conclusion

Three SaaS approaches:

- **Sanity**: Real-time collaboration leader with usage-based pricing risk
- **Contentful**: Enterprise fortress with enterprise pricing
- **SonicJS**: Edge-first performance with data ownership

For teams prioritizing global performance, predictable costs, and avoiding vendor lock-in, SonicJS provides a modern alternative.

## Key Takeaways

- Sanity's custom roles require $949/month enterprise plan
- Contentful Premium starts at $60,000/year
- Both use usage-based pricing that can escalate unexpectedly
- SonicJS delivers under 50ms global latency for $5-20/month
- Edge-first architecture provides performance neither SaaS can match
