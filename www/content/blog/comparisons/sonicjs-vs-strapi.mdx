# SonicJS vs Strapi: Edge-First CMS Comparison

<TLDRBox>
**TL;DR** — SonicJS is an edge-first CMS with zero cold starts and global sub-50ms latency. Strapi is a mature, self-hosted CMS with an extensive plugin ecosystem. Choose SonicJS for performance-critical applications; choose Strapi for complex enterprise requirements.

**Key Stats:**
- SonicJS: 15-30ms API response (vs Strapi: 50-150ms same region)
- SonicJS: 0-5ms cold start (vs Strapi: 500-2000ms)
- Strapi: 100+ marketplace plugins available
- Both: MIT licensed, open source
</TLDRBox>

Choosing the right headless CMS is a critical decision for any project. In this comparison, we'll examine two popular options: SonicJS, an edge-first CMS built for Cloudflare Workers, and Strapi, the established open-source headless CMS.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | SonicJS | Strapi |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Architecture | Edge-first (Cloudflare Workers) | Traditional server |
| Database | D1 (SQLite at edge) | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite |
| Language | TypeScript-native | JavaScript/TypeScript |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Workers | Self-hosted or Strapi Cloud |
| Cold starts | None (V8 isolates) | Yes (container-based) |
| Global latency | Under 50ms worldwide | Varies by server location |
| Admin UI | HTMX-based | React-based |
| License | MIT | MIT (v4) / EE features paid |

## Architecture Deep Dive

### SonicJS: Edge-First Design

SonicJS is built from the ground up to run on Cloudflare Workers. This means your CMS runs in 300+ data centers worldwide, as close as possible to your users.

```typescript
// SonicJS runs at the edge by default
import { createSonicJS } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

const cms = createSonicJS({
  collections: [...],
  plugins: [...],
})

// Deployed to Cloudflare Workers
export default cms.app
```

**Key architectural benefits:**

- **Zero cold starts**: V8 isolates start in milliseconds
- **Global deployment**: Automatic worldwide distribution
- **Integrated storage**: D1, KV, and R2 built-in
- **No server management**: Fully serverless

### Strapi: Traditional Server Architecture

Strapi runs on a traditional Node.js server, which can be self-hosted or deployed to Strapi Cloud.

```javascript
// Strapi requires a persistent server
module.exports = {
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 1337,
  app: {
    keys: env.array('APP_KEYS'),
  },
}
```

**Strapi's architecture considerations:**

- **Server required**: Needs persistent hosting
- **Database flexibility**: Choose your preferred database
- **Mature ecosystem**: Large plugin marketplace
- **More control**: Full access to server configuration

## Performance Comparison

### Response Times

| Scenario | SonicJS | Strapi |
|----------|---------|--------|
| API response (same region) | 15-30ms | 50-150ms |
| API response (cross-region) | 30-60ms | 200-500ms |
| Cold start | 0-5ms | 500-2000ms |
| Cached response | 5-15ms | 20-50ms |

SonicJS's edge-first architecture means consistent sub-50ms response times globally, regardless of where users are located.

### Scaling

**SonicJS**: Scales automatically with Cloudflare's infrastructure. No configuration needed - your CMS handles traffic spikes without intervention.

**Strapi**: Requires manual scaling configuration. You'll need to set up load balancers, manage multiple instances, and handle database connection pooling.

## Developer Experience

### TypeScript Support

**SonicJS**: TypeScript-native from day one. Full type safety from collection definitions to API responses.

```typescript
// SonicJS: Full TypeScript support
import { defineCollection } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: 'posts',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    content: { type: 'richtext' },
  },
})
```

**Strapi**: TypeScript support added in v4, but the codebase is JavaScript-first. Type definitions are available but not as comprehensive.

### Setup Time

**SonicJS**: Get started in under 5 minutes:

```bash
npm create sonicjs-app my-cms
cd my-cms
npm run dev
```

**Strapi**: Similar quick start, but requires more configuration for production:

```bash
npx create-strapi-app my-project
cd my-project
npm run develop
```

## Hosting & Costs

### SonicJS on Cloudflare

- **Free tier**: 100,000 requests/day, 10GB D1 storage
- **Paid**: $5/month for Workers Paid, then pay-as-you-go
- **Predictable scaling**: No surprise bills from traffic spikes

### Strapi Hosting Options

- **Self-hosted**: Server costs + database + maintenance time
- **Strapi Cloud**: Starting at $99/month for production
- **Third-party**: Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.

## Content Modeling

### Collections/Content Types

Both CMS platforms offer flexible content modeling, but with different approaches:

**SonicJS**:
```typescript
const article = defineCollection({
  name: 'articles',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    body: { type: 'richtext' },
    author: { type: 'relation', collection: 'users' },
    tags: { type: 'array', of: 'string' },
  },
})
```

**Strapi**:
```javascript
// Content types defined via admin UI or JSON
{
  "kind": "collectionType",
  "collectionName": "articles",
  "attributes": {
    "title": { "type": "string", "required": true },
    "body": { "type": "richtext" },
    "author": { "type": "relation", "target": "api::user.user" }
  }
}
```

### Relationships

Both support relationships between content types. SonicJS handles this at the edge with efficient query patterns, while Strapi uses traditional database joins.

## Admin Interface

### SonicJS Admin

- Built with HTMX for fast, lightweight interactions
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Responsive and mobile-friendly
- Customizable via plugins

### Strapi Admin

- Full React application
- Feature-rich UI
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Extensive customization options
- Larger bundle size

## Plugin Ecosystem

### SonicJS Plugins

SonicJS has a growing plugin system that runs at the edge:

```typescript
import { PluginBuilder } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

const myPlugin = PluginBuilder.create('my-plugin')
  .addRoute('GET', '/custom', handler)
  .addHook('content:beforeSave', transform)
  .build()
```

The ecosystem is newer but growing rapidly.

### Strapi Plugins

Strapi has a mature marketplace with hundreds of plugins:

- SEO plugins
- Internationalization
- Media optimization
- Authentication providers
- And many more

## When to Choose SonicJS

Choose SonicJS if you:

- Need global low-latency performance
- Want zero cold starts
- Prefer TypeScript-native development
- Want simplified deployment (single command)
- Need predictable, affordable scaling
- Are building API-first applications

## When to Choose Strapi

Choose Strapi if you:

- Need a mature, battle-tested platform
- Require extensive plugin ecosystem
- Want full control over hosting
- Need complex RBAC out of the box
- Prefer a more traditional architecture
- Have an existing Node.js infrastructure

## Migration Considerations

### Migrating to SonicJS

If you're considering moving from Strapi to SonicJS:

1. Export your Strapi content types
2. Convert to SonicJS collection definitions
3. Migrate content via API
4. Update frontend API calls (similar REST patterns)

### Data Compatibility

Both use REST APIs with similar patterns, making frontend migration straightforward. GraphQL users should note that SonicJS focuses on REST.

## Conclusion

SonicJS and Strapi serve different needs:

- **SonicJS** excels in edge-first, globally distributed, TypeScript-native projects where performance is critical
- **Strapi** shines in traditional deployments where a mature ecosystem and extensive plugins are priorities

For new projects prioritizing performance and modern architecture, SonicJS offers a compelling edge-first approach. For projects requiring extensive customization and a proven ecosystem, Strapi remains a solid choice.

## Key Takeaways

- SonicJS offers edge-first architecture with under 50ms global latency
- Strapi provides a mature ecosystem with extensive plugins
- SonicJS has zero cold starts; Strapi requires container warm-up
- Both are open-source with MIT licensing
- SonicJS is TypeScript-native; Strapi is JavaScript-first
- Hosting: SonicJS on Cloudflare is simpler; Strapi offers more flexibility
