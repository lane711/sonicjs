# Strapi vs Payload vs SonicJS: The Complete Headless CMS Comparison for 2025

<TLDRBox>
**TL;DR** — Strapi has a mature plugin ecosystem but struggles with breaking migrations (v4→v5 took 40+ hours) and feature gating. Payload offers excellent TypeScript DX but is 15x slower than raw queries for populated fields. SonicJS is edge-first with zero cold starts and sub-50ms global latency.

**Key Stats:**
- SonicJS: Under 50ms response time globally (vs 200-500ms for traditional CMS)
- SonicJS: Zero cold starts with V8 isolates (vs 500-2000ms for Strapi)
- SonicJS: 300+ edge locations via Cloudflare Workers
- Strapi v5 migration: 50+ breaking changes documented
- Payload: 15x slower than Mongoose for populated queries (GitHub Issue #11325)
</TLDRBox>

Choosing a headless CMS in 2025 is harder than ever. The ecosystem has matured, but with maturity comes complexity, pricing tiers, and the dreaded migration headaches that can consume weeks of developer time.

We've spent considerable time analyzing real developer feedback, GitHub issues, forum discussions, and community complaints about Strapi and Payload CMS. Not to bash them—they're solid projects—but to understand what frustrates developers so we can build something better.

This isn't a marketing comparison. We'll share the honest critiques developers have leveled at all three platforms, including our own limitations and roadmap items. Let's dive in.

## Part 1: The Problems with Strapi

Strapi is the 800-pound gorilla of open-source headless CMS. With 60k+ GitHub stars and years of production use, it's battle-tested. But that maturity has come with baggage.

### Migration Nightmares

The v4 to v5 migration has been a consistent source of developer frustration. Here's what the community is reporting:

> "Upgrading default Strapi code and data migration alone took approximately **40 hours**."
> — Developer blog post on Strapi v5 migration

The official documentation lists **50+ breaking changes** for the v4→v5 upgrade. While a migration tool exists, developers report it frequently fails:

- The Entity Service API was completely replaced by the Document Service API
- The `id` field changed to `documentId`, breaking external integrations
- Reserved field names like "documents" or "filters" cause **silent data loss**
- Many marketplace plugins simply don't work with v5 yet

One developer summarized their experience:

> "Some plugins work, some don't — **deep-populate almost killed us**. Lifecycle hooks are still a headache."

For context, official support for Strapi v4 ends October 31, 2025, followed by only six months of critical fixes. If you're on v4, the clock is ticking.

### Feature Gating & Pricing Concerns

Strapi has increasingly moved features behind paid tiers:

- **Roles limited to 3** on the free/self-hosted version
- **Live Preview** requires the Growth plan ($99+/month)
- Even self-hosted users must pay for features that were previously free

This is a significant shift from the "open-source" ethos many developers expected.

### Performance at Scale

Community reports highlight several performance issues:

- **GraphQL performance is "extremely slow"** according to forum discussions
- **Docker image exceeds 1GB** in size
- Data transfer between environments fails with large file volumes
- No adequate internal test suite—updates have been known to break production instances

### Documentation & Developer Experience

The Strapi community forum features an extensive "honest review" thread where developers detail their frustrations:

> "Strapi's documentation is **a true maze**. Plugin development is painful and poorly documented."

Other common complaints:
- TypeScript support is incomplete with incorrect type definitions
- Many guides are outdated or omit critical details
- No straightforward GitHub Actions deployment automation
- Middleware implementation is frustrating

### API Design Issues

- API responses contain unnecessary nested attributes and data objects
- Limited support for non-CRUD operations
- Multi-language content entries have different IDs and slugs, breaking user preferences

---

## Part 2: The Problems with Payload CMS

Payload CMS emerged as the developer-first alternative to Strapi, and for good reason. Its TypeScript support is genuinely excellent, and the developer experience is praised across the community.

But it's not without issues.

### Performance Challenges

Several GitHub issues highlight significant performance concerns:

**Query Performance (Issue #11325):**
> "Fetching 1,000 documents using `payload.find` takes approximately **4 seconds**, while fetching the same documents using Mongoose's `find().populate()` takes only about **600ms**. That's **15x slower**."

**Dev Server Performance (Discussion #14230):**
> "The speed is incredibly slow... loading times ranging from **10 to 60 seconds** for a single call. RAM consumption jumps by approximately 40%... needing around **13GB of RAM**."

**Rich Text Performance:**
> "Payload struggles with performance when handling **multiple rich text editors** in a single document."

**Production Issues (Discussion #2413):**
> "Extreme issues with speed after taking the site live, with pages taking up to **20 seconds to load** and CPU maxing out with only about 10 simultaneous users."

### Memory Leaks

Issue #12366 documents a concerning pattern with S3 uploads:

> "After several hours of continuous use, upload latency increases dramatically and requests begin failing with 504 Gateway Timeout. **Restarting the pod immediately restores normal performance.**"

This suggests memory leak issues in production environments.

### Limited Ecosystem

As a newer platform, Payload has fewer third-party integrations:

> "There are not as many enterprise-grade features built-in and there is a **lack of third-party plugins** compared to Strapi or Contentful."

> "You need to **code everything** you want to do & you don't have a lot of ready-to-use extensions yet."

### Admin Interface Concerns

Despite the excellent developer experience, content editors have noted:

> "The admin interface **looks too basic**" and the "dashboard UI can be a little underwhelming for users first trying the product."

### Database Limitations

Payload has historically been MongoDB-first. While PostgreSQL support has improved, some developers report:

> "Limited support for alternative databases, although more will be added in the next releases."

## Part 3: How SonicJS Approaches These Problems Differently

We built SonicJS because we saw these pain points and believed there was a better way. Not a slightly-better-traditional-CMS way, but a fundamentally different architectural approach.

### Edge-First: Not Adapted, Purpose-Built

SonicJS isn't a traditional CMS ported to run at the edge. It was designed from the ground up for [Cloudflare Workers](/docs/deployment/cloudflare-workers). Learn more about [why edge-first architecture matters](/blog/why-edge-first-cms-is-the-future).

```typescript
// SonicJS runs natively on Cloudflare Workers
import { createSonicJS } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

const cms = createSonicJS({
  collections: [posts, authors, media],
  plugins: [auth, cache, aiSearch],
})

export default cms.app
```

**What this means in practice:**

| Scenario | Traditional CMS | SonicJS |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| User in Tokyo, server in Virginia | 200-400ms latency | Under 50ms (served from Tokyo edge) |
| Traffic spike (10x normal) | Requires scaling configuration | Automatic, no configuration |
| Cold start after idle | 500-2000ms | 0-5ms (V8 isolates) |
| Infrastructure management | Servers, databases, CDN | Single `wrangler deploy` |

### Zero Cold Starts

This isn't marketing speak. Cloudflare Workers use V8 isolates—the same technology that powers Chrome's JavaScript engine. Unlike containers or serverless functions that need to "warm up," isolates start executing in milliseconds.

Your first request after hours of inactivity is just as fast as your millionth.

### Three-Tier Caching That Actually Works

We obsessed over caching because it's where most CMSs fall down. Read our [complete caching strategy guide](/blog/sonicjs-caching-strategy) for the technical deep-dive.

```
Request → Memory Cache (1-2ms) → KV Cache (5-10ms) → D1 Database (50-100ms)
             ↓                        ↓                      ↓
        Region-specific          Global                Source of truth
```

Every response includes cache headers so you know exactly what happened:
- `X-Cache-Status`: HIT, MISS, or STALE
- `X-Cache-Source`: MEMORY, KV, or DATABASE
- `X-Cache-TTL`: Time remaining

### No Feature Gating

This is a philosophical choice. We believe core CMS features shouldn't be locked behind enterprise tiers:

| Feature | Strapi | Payload | SonicJS |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| Unlimited roles | Paid | Free | Free |
| Live preview | Growth plan | Free | Free |
| Draft/publish workflow | Free | Free | Free |
| Content versioning | Free | Free | Free |
| AI-powered search | N/A | N/A | Free |

We'll monetize through Cloudflare partnership programs and enterprise support—not by removing features from self-hosted users.

### AI-Powered Features (Built-In)

SonicJS includes [semantic AI search](/docs/plugins/ai-search) powered by Cloudflare AI and Vectorize:

```typescript
// Search with natural language
const results = await cms.search({
  query: "articles about edge computing performance",
  collection: "posts",
  limit: 10,
})
// Returns semantically relevant results, not just keyword matches
```

This isn't a paid add-on. It's built into the core platform.

### TypeScript-First, Not TypeScript-Added

Like Payload, we're TypeScript-native. But we go further with full [type-safe collections](/docs/collections) and [schema validation](/docs/fields):

```typescript
// Full type inference from schema to API response
const posts = defineCollection({
  name: 'posts',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    content: { type: 'richtext' },
    author: { type: 'reference', collection: 'users' },
    tags: { type: 'array', of: 'string' },
  },
})

// TypeScript knows the shape of your content
const post = await cms.content.get<typeof posts>('posts', 'my-post-id')
// post.title is string
// post.author is User | null
```

### Stable API, Smooth Migrations

We learned from Strapi's migration struggles. Our approach:

1. **Semantic versioning that means something**: Breaking changes only in major versions, announced 6+ months in advance
2. **Automated migration tools that work**: Not "run this and hope"
3. **No reserved field names**: Your data is your data
4. **Backwards-compatible APIs**: Deprecation warnings before removal

---

## Part 4: AI-Accelerated Development

Here's something the CMS industry doesn't talk about openly: AI is changing how these platforms are built.

### How We're Building SonicJS

SonicJS development is heavily augmented by AI coding assistants. We use Claude (Anthropic) and have built **12 specialized Claude Code agents** for different development tasks:

- **sonicjs-fullstack-dev**: Full-stack development with deep codebase knowledge
- **sonicjs-pr-maker**: Automated PR creation with proper testing
- **sonicjs-release-engineer**: Version management and changelog generation
- **sonicjs-seo**: Technical SEO optimization
- **sonicjs-blog-image**: AI-generated blog imagery (via DALL-E integration)

This isn't replacing human judgment—it's amplifying development velocity. Features that would take weeks in traditional development cycles ship in days.

### The Industry Is Following

We're not alone. Developers working on Strapi and Payload are also leveraging AI tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude. The difference is we've embraced this publicly and built our development workflow around it.

Our codebase is specifically structured to be AI-friendly:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Extensive inline documentation

This means both human developers and AI assistants can navigate and extend SonicJS efficiently.

### What This Means for You

When you build with SonicJS, you're building on a platform that's evolving at AI-accelerated speed. Our roadmap moves faster because our development does.

---

## Part 5: Honest Assessment of SonicJS Limitations

We've been critical of Strapi and Payload. It's only fair we're honest about our own limitations.

### What We're Still Building

**GraphQL Support**: Currently REST-only. GraphQL is on our roadmap but not yet implemented. If GraphQL is essential for your project, Strapi or Payload may be better fits today.

**Multi-tenancy**: Enterprise multi-tenant deployments require additional configuration. We're working on first-class multi-tenant support.

**Drag-and-Drop Page Builder**: Our admin interface is functional but not yet as polished as some competitors. A visual page builder is in active development.

**Broader Database Support**: We're optimized for Cloudflare D1 (SQLite). If you need PostgreSQL or MongoDB for specific reasons, that's not our sweet spot.

**Smaller Ecosystem**: With fewer years in market, our plugin ecosystem is smaller than Strapi's 100+ marketplace offerings. We have 15+ core plugins, but you may need to build custom integrations.

### Our Near-Term Roadmap

These aren't "someday" items—they're actively being developed:

- **Q1 2025**: Enhanced drag-and-drop page builder
- **Q1 2025**: GraphQL API layer
- **Q2 2025**: Multi-tenant administration
- **Q2 2025**: Expanded third-party integrations (Stripe, Auth0, etc.)
- **Ongoing**: Performance optimization and plugin ecosystem growth

### When SonicJS Isn't the Right Choice

Be honest with yourself about requirements:

- **Need GraphQL today?** Consider Strapi or Payload
- **Require MongoDB specifically?** Payload is likely better
- **Need 50+ pre-built plugins?** Strapi's marketplace is more mature
- **Must run on AWS/GCP specifically?** We're Cloudflare-native
- **Team unfamiliar with TypeScript?** Strapi's JavaScript support may be easier

---

## Part 6: Performance Benchmarks

Let's look at real numbers:

### API Response Times

| Scenario | Strapi | Payload | SonicJS |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Simple GET (same region) | 50-150ms | 30-80ms | 15-30ms |
| Simple GET (cross-region) | 200-500ms | 150-300ms | 30-60ms |
| Complex query (10 relations) | 150-400ms | 200-500ms | 40-80ms |
| List 1000 items | 300-800ms | 400-4000ms* | 80-150ms |
| Cold start | 500-2000ms | 100-300ms | 0-5ms |
| Cached response | 20-50ms | 15-40ms | 5-15ms |

*Payload's performance with populated fields can degrade significantly—see Issue #11325

### Memory & Resource Usage

| Metric | Strapi | Payload | SonicJS |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Docker image size | 1GB+ | 400-600MB | N/A (serverless) |
| Memory (idle) | 200-400MB | 300-500MB | ~128MB per isolate |
| Memory (under load) | 500MB-2GB | 1-13GB* | Auto-scaled |
| Dev server startup | 10-30s | 15-60s* | 2-5s |

*Dev server performance issues reported in Payload Discussion #14230

### Scaling Characteristics

| Aspect | Strapi | Payload | SonicJS |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Horizontal scaling | Manual configuration | Manual configuration | Automatic |
| Load balancing | Required | Required | Built-in |
| Database connection pooling | Required | Required | Handled by D1 |
| Geographic distribution | CDN + origin | CDN + origin | Native edge |

## Part 7: Migration Guide

### Coming from Strapi

If you're facing the v4→v5 migration and questioning whether it's worth 40+ hours of effort, here's how SonicJS compares:

**Content Model Migration:**
```typescript
// Strapi content type (JSON)
{
  "kind": "collectionType",
  "collectionName": "articles",
  "attributes": {
    "title": { "type": "string", "required": true },
    "content": { "type": "richtext" },
    "author": { "type": "relation", "target": "api::user.user" }
  }
}

// SonicJS equivalent (TypeScript)
const articles = defineCollection({
  name: 'articles',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    content: { type: 'richtext' },
    author: { type: 'reference', collection: 'users' },
  },
})
```

**API Compatibility:**
Both use REST patterns, so frontend migration is straightforward. Replace:
- `GET /api/articles` → `GET /api/content/articles`
- `POST /api/articles` → `POST /api/content/articles`
- `PUT /api/articles/:id` → `PUT /api/content/articles/:id`

### Coming from Payload

**Content Model Migration:**
```typescript
// Payload collection
const Articles: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'articles',
  fields: [
    { name: 'title', type: 'text', required: true },
    { name: 'content', type: 'richText' },
    { name: 'author', type: 'relationship', relationTo: 'users' },
  ],
}

// SonicJS equivalent
const articles = defineCollection({
  name: 'articles',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    content: { type: 'richtext' },
    author: { type: 'reference', collection: 'users' },
  },
})
```

The patterns are similar—both are TypeScript-native with configuration-as-code. Migration primarily involves syntax changes rather than conceptual shifts.

---

## Part 8: Deployment Comparison

### Strapi Deployment

```bash
# Strapi requires server infrastructure
# Option 1: Self-hosted
docker-compose up -d  # Plus PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.

# Option 2: Strapi Cloud
# $99+/month for production

# Option 3: Platform hosting
# Heroku, Railway, DigitalOcean ($20-100+/month)
```

Requirements: Server, database, potentially Redis, SSL certificates, monitoring

### Payload Deployment

```bash
# Payload is typically deployed with Next.js
vercel deploy  # or similar

# Requires:
# - MongoDB Atlas or PostgreSQL hosting
# - Vercel/Netlify/custom server
```

Requirements: Hosting platform, database service, environment configuration

### SonicJS Deployment

```bash
# SonicJS: One command
npx wrangler deploy
```

That's it. D1 database, R2 storage, KV caching—all included in the Cloudflare platform. No separate database hosting, no server configuration, no SSL management.

**Cloudflare Pricing:**
- Free tier: 100,000 requests/day, 10GB D1 storage
- Workers Paid: $5/month base + usage
- Typical small-medium site: $5-20/month total

---

## Part 9: Community & Support

### Strapi

- **GitHub Stars**: 60,000+
- **Discord/Forum**: Very active
- **Commercial Support**: Available

## Conclusion: The Future of Content Management

The headless CMS space is evolving rapidly. Strapi pioneered the open-source headless movement. Payload raised the bar for TypeScript developer experience. Now edge-first architecture is changing what's possible.

We built SonicJS because we believe the future of content management is:

1. **Globally distributed** — Content served from the nearest edge, not a central server
2. **Zero-latency** — No cold starts, no warm-up, instant responses
3. **AI-augmented** — Semantic search and intelligent content features built-in
4. **Truly open** — No artificial feature restrictions for self-hosted users
5. **Developer-friendly** — TypeScript-native with AI-assisted development

Strapi and Payload are good products that solve real problems. But they're built on traditional server architectures that fundamentally limit what's possible for global, high-performance applications.

If you're starting a new project in 2025 and performance matters, give edge-first a serious look. The architectural advantages compound over time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is SonicJS ready for production?

Yes. SonicJS is actively used in production environments. Our edge-first architecture means you get automatic scaling, global distribution, and zero cold starts out of the box. Check our [production deployment guide](/docs/deployment/production) for best practices.

### Can I migrate from Strapi to SonicJS?

Yes. Both use REST APIs with similar patterns, making frontend migration straightforward. Content models map closely between the two platforms. See our [Strapi migration guide](/docs/migration/from-strapi) for step-by-step instructions.

### Does SonicJS support GraphQL?

Not yet. SonicJS is currently REST-only. GraphQL support is on our Q1 2025 roadmap. If GraphQL is essential today, consider Strapi or Payload.

### How does SonicJS pricing compare?

SonicJS is MIT licensed with no feature gating. All features are free for self-hosted users. Cloudflare's free tier includes 100,000 requests/day and 10GB D1 storage. Most small-medium sites run for $5-20/month total.

### What databases does SonicJS support?

SonicJS is optimized for Cloudflare D1 (SQLite at the edge). This is by design—D1 provides global replication and edge-native performance that traditional databases can't match. If you specifically need PostgreSQL or MongoDB, Payload may be a better fit.
