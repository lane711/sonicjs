# Strapi vs Directus vs SonicJS: The Complete Open-Source Headless CMS Comparison

<TLDRBox>
**TL;DR** — Strapi leads in popularity with 163k weekly npm downloads and a mature plugin ecosystem, but limits free users to 3 roles and struggles with migrations. Directus excels at wrapping existing databases but faces performance issues at scale (1.5s average response with complex relations). SonicJS delivers sub-50ms global latency with edge-first architecture and no feature gating.

**Key Stats:**
- Strapi: 163k weekly downloads, but only 3 roles on free tier
- Directus: 45s+ response times reported with 400k files (GitHub Issue #7783)
- SonicJS: Under 50ms globally, zero cold starts, unlimited roles free
- Strapi v5: Content versioning requires paid plan ($99+/month)
- Directus: Supports 6 database types vs Strapi's 4
</TLDRBox>

If you're searching "Strapi vs Directus," you're likely evaluating the two most popular open-source headless CMS options. Both are excellent projects with years of production use. But in 2025, there's a third option worth considering: edge-first architecture.

We've analyzed GitHub issues, community forums, and real developer feedback to understand where each platform shines and struggles. This isn't a marketing piece—we'll be honest about all three platforms, including SonicJS's current limitations.

## Part 1: The Case for Strapi

Strapi is the most popular open-source headless CMS with 65k+ GitHub stars and 163k weekly npm downloads. It's battle-tested and has the largest plugin ecosystem.

### What Strapi Does Well

**Mature Ecosystem**: With years of development and $45 million in funding, Strapi offers:
- 100+ marketplace plugins
- Extensive documentation
- Large community for support
- Native integrations with Cloudinary, Shopify, BigCommerce

**Strapi 5 Features (2024)**:
- Live Preview functionality
- Strapi AI for schema design
- Feature Flags
- Drag-and-Drop Content Blocks
- Releases for bundled publishing

**Developer Experience**: JavaScript/TypeScript developers find Strapi's React-based admin intuitive. The code-first approach with JSON schema files works well for version control.

### Strapi's Pain Points

We covered Strapi extensively in our [Strapi vs Payload comparison](/blog/strapi-vs-payload-vs-sonicjs), but here are the key issues:

**Role Limitations**:
> Strapi's free version imposes an inexplicable limit of 3 roles, whereas Directus offers the flexibility to create an unlimited number of roles.

**Content Versioning Gated**:
Content versioning is only available on paid plans (Growth $99+/month and Enterprise). This was free in competitors years ago.

**Migration Nightmares**:
The v4 to v5 migration involves 50+ breaking changes and took some developers 40+ hours.

**GraphQL Limitations**:
> Strapi's GraphQL queries have default pagination limits, typically retrieving only 10-25 items per request. File uploads cannot be done through GraphQL endpoints, forcing teams to switch between GraphQL for content queries and REST for media operations.

---

## Part 2: The Case for Directus

Directus takes a fundamentally different approach: it wraps existing SQL databases rather than managing its own schema. This makes it powerful for enterprises with legacy systems.

### What Directus Does Well

**Database Flexibility**:
Directus supports 6 database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL, Oracle, CockroachDB) and can connect to existing tables created by other systems.

> Directus can be set up on top of an existing database to provide CMS features and APIs to work alongside other systems that may also use the same database.

**Unlimited Roles Free**:
Unlike Strapi, Directus offers unlimited roles and a powerful permissions system without paid tiers.

**Content Versioning Free**:
Full version history and restore capabilities included in the open-source version.

**Vue.js Admin**:
Developers report Directus's Vue-based admin offers "better customization, speed, and overall coherence" compared to Strapi's React admin.

**2025 Updates**:
- Visual Editing features
- Node 22 support
- Refreshed Kanban layouts
- Improved translations

### Directus Pain Points

Our research uncovered significant performance and stability concerns documented across multiple GitHub issues:

**Documented Performance Issues from GitHub:**

| Issue | Scenario | Reported Time | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------|
| [#11766](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/11766) | 15 relations, 10 req/s | 1,500ms avg | runAST bottleneck |
| [#7783](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/7783) | 400k files | 45,000ms+ | Heap out of memory |
| [#1575](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1575) | Simple queries | 4,000ms | Cold query performance |
| [#2020](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2020) | 1,000 items | 5,500ms | Collection listing |
| [#1743](https://github.com/directus/v8-archive/issues/1743) | Basic API calls | 150-1000ms | SSR unusable |
| [#26153](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/26153) | Admin app after upgrade | 300-900ms delay | v11.13.1 regression |
| [#10034](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/10034) | 200 row inserts | Connection crashes | Pool exhaustion |

**Severe Performance Issues at Scale**:

From GitHub Issue #11766:
> "Collections with around 15 relations (translations, images, taxonomy) and extensive permissions cause significant slowdowns. For 10 unique requests per second, each request by average took **1.5s**. Most of that time was spent on the runAST function."

From GitHub Issue #7783:
> "The response time for data seems related to the amount of files stored with Directus, getting slower as more files are created. With nearly 400,000 files, the response time reaches about **45 seconds or more**. The app started crashing with a JavaScript heap out of memory error."

**Additional Performance Reports** (Issues #1575, #2020):
> "Simple queries taking **4 seconds**. Listing 1,000 items takes **5.5 seconds**."

**Connection Pool Crashes** (Issue #10034):
> "When inserting up to 200 rows, Directus starts after few minutes to slow down and crash. Users encounter 'KnexTimeoutError: Knex: Timeout acquiring a connection. The pool is probably full.'"

**API Response Times** (Issue #1743):
> "The API takes a really long time to respond to even the simplest requests, ranging from ~150ms in the best cases to almost a whole second. This makes Directus **impossible to use in server-side rendering**."

**Missing Database Indexes**:
> "Directus does not create any indexes on foreign keys, even in translations."

**Recent Performance Regression** (Issue #26153):
> "After upgrading Directus from v11.12.0 to v11.13.1, the Admin App list views load noticeably slower... there is a ~300–900ms delay before data renders."

**Bug Reports**:
Community feedback includes complaints about "a lot of bugs" including SQL query problems, broken login when cache is enabled, and UI issues that led some users to switch platforms.

**Not Enterprise-Ready** (for some):
> "This is not an enterprise-level application, yet. Editorial features and workflows fall short for enterprise requirements."

---

## Part 3: Why Edge-First Changes Everything

Both Strapi and Directus run on traditional Node.js servers. This means:
- Single geographic location (unless you configure complex multi-region deployments)
- Cold starts when containers spin up
- Database connection pooling challenges
- Manual scaling configuration

SonicJS takes a fundamentally different approach.

### Edge-First Architecture

SonicJS runs natively on Cloudflare Workers—300+ data centers worldwide, serving content from the nearest location to each user.

```typescript
// SonicJS runs at the edge by default
import { createSonicJS } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

const cms = createSonicJS({
  collections: [posts, authors, categories],
  plugins: [auth, cache, aiSearch],
})

export default cms.app
```

**Performance Comparison**:

| Scenario | Strapi | Directus | SonicJS |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Simple GET (same region) | 50-150ms | 50-200ms | 15-30ms |
| Simple GET (cross-region) | 200-500ms | 200-500ms | 30-60ms |
| Complex query (relations) | 150-400ms | 500-1500ms* | 40-80ms |
| Cold start | 500-2000ms | 300-1000ms | 0-5ms |
| With 400k files | Unknown | 45,000ms+ | Under 100ms |

*Directus performance degrades significantly with complex relations per GitHub Issue #11766

### Zero Cold Starts

Cloudflare Workers use V8 isolates, not containers. Your first request after hours of inactivity performs identically to your millionth request.

### Three-Tier Caching

Read our [complete caching strategy guide](/blog/sonicjs-caching-strategy) for details:

```
Request → Memory Cache (1-2ms) → KV Cache (5-10ms) → D1 Database (50-100ms)
```

### No Feature Gating

| Feature | Strapi | Directus | SonicJS |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| Unlimited roles | Paid | Free | Free |
| Content versioning | Paid | Free | Free |
| Live preview | Paid | Free | Free |
| AI-powered search | N/A | N/A | Free |
| SSO/SAML | Paid | Paid | Roadmap |

We believe core CMS features shouldn't require enterprise pricing.

---

## Part 4: Database Philosophy

Each CMS has a distinct approach to data:

### Strapi: Code-Driven Schema

Strapi requires you to maintain schema in JSON files. It manages the underlying database automatically.

```javascript
// Strapi content type (JSON in code)
{
  "kind": "collectionType",
  "collectionName": "articles",
  "attributes": {
    "title": { "type": "string", "required": true },
    "content": { "type": "richtext" }
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Version control friendly, consistent deployments
**Cons**: Can't wrap existing databases, migration complexity

### Directus: Database-First

Directus wraps existing SQL tables, making it powerful for legacy integration.

```sql
-- Directus can manage tables you already have
CREATE TABLE articles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  content TEXT
);
-- Then connect Directus and it introspects the schema
```

**Pros**: Works with existing systems, multiple DB support
**Cons**: Performance issues with complex schemas, no built-in indexes

### SonicJS: Edge-Native

SonicJS uses TypeScript schemas that compile to edge-optimized queries:

```typescript
// SonicJS collection definition
const articles = defineCollection({
  name: 'articles',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    content: { type: 'richtext' },
    author: { type: 'reference', collection: 'users' },
  },
})
```

**Pros**: Type-safe, edge-optimized, globally distributed
**Cons**: D1 (SQLite) only, can't wrap existing databases

---

## Part 5: Developer Experience

### Admin Interface

**Strapi** (React):
- Familiar for React developers
- Extensive customization options
- Larger bundle size

**Directus** (Vue):
- Praised for "better customization, speed, and overall coherence"
- Powerful permissions UI
- Clean, modern interface

**SonicJS** (HTMX):
- Lightweight, minimal JavaScript
- Fast load times
- Mobile-responsive
- Growing customization options

### TypeScript Support

| Platform | TypeScript | Type Safety |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Strapi | Added in v4 | Partial, some incorrect types reported |
| Directus | Yes | SDK with types |
| SonicJS | Native | Full type inference from schema to API |

### Content Modeling

All three support:
- Text, rich text, numbers, dates, booleans
- Relations (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Media/file fields
- JSON/flexible fields

**Directus advantage**: Many-to-Any relationships (though some users report issues)
**SonicJS advantage**: Type-safe [collections](/docs/collections) with [schema validation](/docs/fields)

---

## Part 6: Deployment & Operations

### Strapi Deployment

```bash
# Requires server + database
docker-compose up -d  # Plus PostgreSQL, Redis

# Or Strapi Cloud: $99+/month for production
```

Requirements: Server, database, potentially Redis, monitoring, SSL

### Directus Deployment

```bash
# Similar traditional deployment
docker run directus/directus

# Requires database connection
DATABASE_CLIENT=postgres
DATABASE_HOST=your-db-host
```

Requirements: Server, supported database, proper indexing (not auto-created)

### SonicJS Deployment

```bash
# One command to production
npx wrangler deploy
```

D1, R2, KV—all included. No separate database hosting.

**Cloudflare Pricing**:
- Free: 100,000 requests/day, 10GB D1 storage
- Paid: $5/month base + usage
- Typical site: $5-20/month total

---

## Part 7: When to Choose Each

### Choose Strapi If:

- You need the largest plugin ecosystem
- Your team prefers React-based admin
- You're willing to pay for features like versioning
- You want managed hosting (Strapi Cloud)
- Plugin marketplace variety is critical

### Choose Directus If:

- You need to wrap an existing SQL database
- You require support for Oracle, MSSQL, or CockroachDB
- Unlimited roles are essential (without paying)
- Your datasets are relatively small (avoid performance issues)
- You prefer Vue.js for admin customization

### Choose SonicJS If:

- Global performance matters (sub-50ms latency)
- You want zero cold starts
- You prefer edge-native architecture
- You value true open-source (no feature gating)
- You want [AI-powered search](/docs/plugins/ai-search) built-in
- Simple deployment is important (single command)
- You're building for scale without infrastructure complexity

---

## Part 8: Honest SonicJS Limitations

We've been critical of Strapi and Directus. Here's what SonicJS doesn't do (yet):

**No GraphQL**: Currently REST-only. GraphQL is on our roadmap.

**No Existing Database Wrapping**: Unlike Directus, we can't connect to your existing PostgreSQL or MySQL tables.

**D1 Only**: We're optimized for Cloudflare D1. No PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB support.

**Smaller Ecosystem**: Fewer plugins than Strapi's 100+ marketplace offerings.

**Newer Platform**: Less battle-tested than platforms with 5+ years in production.

### Our Roadmap

- **Q1 2025**: GraphQL API layer
- **Q1 2025**: Enhanced visual page builder
- **Q2 2025**: Multi-tenant administration
- **Q2 2025**: Expanded third-party integrations

---

## Part 9: Migration Considerations

### Coming from Strapi

Both use REST APIs with similar patterns:
- `GET /api/articles` → `GET /api/content/articles`
- Content model concepts map directly

See our [Strapi migration guide](/docs/migration/from-strapi).

### Coming from Directus

If you're hitting Directus performance walls:
1. Export content via Directus API
2. Define equivalent SonicJS collections
3. Import via SonicJS API
4. Update frontend API calls

The REST patterns are similar, but you'll gain edge performance.

---

## Conclusion

**Strapi** is the safe, popular choice with the largest ecosystem—but you'll pay for features that should be free, and migrations are painful.

**Directus** shines for legacy database integration—but performance degrades with scale, and it's not yet enterprise-ready for complex workloads.

**SonicJS** represents the next generation: edge-first architecture that delivers sub-50ms global performance without the infrastructure complexity or feature gating of traditional CMS platforms.

If you're starting a new project in 2025 and performance matters, edge-first architecture offers compelling advantages that compound over time.
