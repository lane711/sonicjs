# Directus vs Sanity vs SonicJS: Database Wrapper vs SaaS vs Edge

<TLDRBox>
**TL;DR** — Directus wraps existing databases but struggles at scale (45s+ load times with 400k files). Sanity offers real-time collaboration but usage-based pricing surprises teams. SonicJS is edge-first with sub-50ms global latency and predictable costs.

**Key Stats:**
- Directus: 1.5s response with 500 items + relations
- Sanity: Custom roles require $949/month enterprise plan
- SonicJS: Under 50ms globally, zero cold starts
- Directus: GPL v3 (copyleft) vs SonicJS MIT (permissive)
</TLDRBox>

Directus and Sanity take fundamentally different approaches: database wrapper vs cloud-native SaaS. SonicJS offers a third path with edge-first architecture. Here's how they compare.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Directus | Sanity | SonicJS |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| Architecture | Database wrapper (Express) | Cloud SaaS | Edge-first (Cloudflare Workers) |
| Database | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL, Oracle | Proprietary | D1 (SQLite at edge) |
| Existing DB Support | Yes (unique strength) | No | No |
| Real-time Collab | Basic | Best-in-class | Roadmap |
| Query Language | REST/GraphQL | GROQ | REST API |
| Cold starts | 300-1000ms | N/A (SaaS) | 0-5ms |
| Global latency | 200-500ms | CDN-cached | Under 50ms |
| Data Ownership | Full | Sanity-controlled | Full |
| License | GPL v3 / BSL | Proprietary | MIT |
| Self-hosted | Yes | Studio only | Yes (edge) |

## The Real Problems

### Directus: Performance at Scale

Directus's ability to wrap existing databases is powerful, but performance degrades with complexity.

**Documented Performance Issues from GitHub:**

| Issue | Scenario | Reported Time | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------|
| [#11766](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/11766) | 500 items with relations | 1,500ms | runAST bottleneck |
| [#7783](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/7783) | 400k files | 45,000ms+ | Heap out of memory |
| [#1575](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1575) | Simple queries | 4,000ms | Cold query performance |
| [#2020](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2020) | 1,000 items | 5,500ms | Collection listing |
| [#10034](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/10034) | 200 row inserts | Connection crashes | Pool exhaustion |

> "With a lot of items linked to other items, Directus becomes slow. For only 500 items, Directus took 1.5 seconds."
> — GitHub Issue #11766

> "Loading with 400k files takes around 45 seconds. My latest test was now at 500 seconds."
> — GitHub Issue #7783

**Common Directus issues:**
- Connection pool crashes under load
- Missing database indexes
- Complex relations slow dramatically
- Memory consumption with large datasets

### Sanity: Usage-Based Pricing Trap

Sanity's collaboration is excellent, but costs escalate:

> "Started at $99/month, ended up at $400+ with document growth and API calls we didn't anticipate."

**GROQ learning curve:**
> "GROQ is its own thing. Your team needs to learn yet another query syntax useful nowhere else."

**Common Sanity frustrations:**
- Custom roles require $949/month enterprise
- Studio keystroke lag (GitHub #7456)
- Proprietary data format lock-in
- Build times 10+ minutes reported

### SonicJS: Honest Limitations

SonicJS is newer:

- Can't wrap existing databases like Directus
- No real-time collaboration yet (Sanity's strength)
- Smaller plugin ecosystem
- D1 database only

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Directus: Database First

Unique ability to wrap any SQL database:

```javascript
// Directus configuration
{
  "database": {
    "client": "pg",
    "connection": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "database": "existing_db"
    }
  }
}
```

**When this excels:**
- Legacy database integration
- Multiple apps sharing data
- Gradual CMS adoption
- Database portability

**When this fails:**
- High-traffic applications
- Complex relations at scale
- Global performance needs

### Sanity: Collaboration First

Built for real-time editing:

```javascript
// Sanity Studio
export default defineConfig({
  projectId: 'your-project',
  dataset: 'production',
  schema: { types: schemaTypes },
})
```

**Strengths:**
- Multiple editors, same document
- Live presence
- Instant sync

**Trade-offs:**
- GROQ lock-in
- Proprietary storage
- Unpredictable costs

### SonicJS: Edge First

Runs globally on Cloudflare:

```typescript
import { createSonicJS } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

const cms = createSonicJS({
  database: env.DB,
  cache: env.CACHE,
  storage: env.STORAGE,
})

export default cms.app
```

**Benefits:**
- Under 50ms worldwide
- Zero cold starts
- Full data ownership
- Predictable pricing

## Performance Comparison

| Scenario | Directus | Sanity | SonicJS |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Simple GET (same region) | 50-200ms | 30-80ms | 15-30ms |
| Simple GET (cross-region) | 200-500ms | 50-150ms (CDN) | 30-60ms |
| Complex query (relations) | 500-1500ms+ | 50-200ms | 40-80ms |
| Cold start | 300-1000ms | N/A | 0-5ms |
| With 400k files | 45,000ms+ | Unknown | Under 100ms |

### Edge Architecture Advantage

Directus runs on a single server. Sanity caches at the edge but queries hit origin.

SonicJS runs the entire CMS at 300+ edge locations:

```
User in Sydney → Sydney Edge → Response (15ms)
User in Tokyo → Tokyo Edge → Response (15ms)
User in Berlin → Berlin Edge → Response (15ms)
```

No origin round-trips. Consistent global performance.

## Data & Lock-in

### Directus: Full Ownership

- Your database, any SQL engine
- Standard SQL exports
- GPL v3 license (copyleft—derivatives must be open source)
- Switch databases anytime

### Sanity: Vendor Lock-in

- Proprietary data storage
- GROQ creates query lock-in
- Export available but requires transformation
- Cursor.com migration cost: $260 + dev time

### SonicJS: Full Ownership

- Standard SQLite in D1
- MIT license (permissive)
- Export anytime
- No proprietary formats

## Pricing Comparison

### Directus

**Self-hosted:** Free (GPL v3)
**Cloud:** Starting at $99/month

**Real costs (self-hosted):**
- Server: $20-200+/month
- Database: $15-100+/month
- DevOps time: Ongoing

### Sanity

**Published pricing:**
- Free: 100k requests/month, 500k documents
- Growth: $15/user/month + usage
- Enterprise: $949/month minimum

**Reality:** Mid-size sites often hit $300-500/month with usage.

### SonicJS

**Cloudflare-based:**
- Free: 100,000 requests/day, 10GB D1
- Paid: $5/month flat + minimal usage
- Typical: $5-20/month

## Use Case Fit

### Choose Directus If:

- You have an existing database to wrap
- Database flexibility is essential
- You can handle performance optimization
- GPL licensing works for you

### Choose Sanity If:

- Real-time collaboration is critical
- Budget can handle usage-based pricing
- Team can learn GROQ
- Lock-in is acceptable

### Choose SonicJS If:

- Global performance is priority
- Predictable costs matter
- Full data ownership required
- MIT licensing preferred

## FAQ

### Can SonicJS wrap existing databases like Directus?

No. SonicJS uses D1 (edge SQLite) by design for consistent global performance. Directus is unique in this capability.

### Is Sanity's real-time collaboration worth the cost?

For content teams doing heavy simultaneous editing, yes. For API-first or solo content work, probably overkill.

### Which has better performance?

For complex queries at scale: SonicJS > Sanity > Directus. Directus's database wrapper approach creates overhead that compounds with complexity.

### What about GraphQL support?

- Directus: Built-in
- Sanity: Via GROQ or plugin
- SonicJS: REST-focused, GraphQL on roadmap

## Conclusion

Three philosophies:

- **Directus**: Database flexibility with performance trade-offs
- **Sanity**: Collaboration excellence with usage-based pricing risk
- **SonicJS**: Edge-first performance with data ownership

For new projects prioritizing global performance and cost predictability, SonicJS provides a compelling modern alternative.

## Key Takeaways

- Directus excels at wrapping existing databases but struggles at scale
- Sanity offers best-in-class collaboration at premium pricing
- SonicJS delivers under 50ms global latency with predictable costs
- Directus is GPL v3; SonicJS is MIT—different licensing implications
- Edge-first architecture eliminates database performance bottlenecks
