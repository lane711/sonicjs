# Getting Started with SonicJS: Complete Beginner's Guide

<TLDRBox>
**TL;DR** — SonicJS is an edge-first headless CMS that runs on Cloudflare Workers. Create a project with `npm create sonicjs-app`, define your content collections in TypeScript, and deploy globally with a single command.

**Key Stats:**
- Under 5 minutes to get a fully functional CMS running
- 1 command deployment: `npm run deploy`
- Full REST API auto-generated from your schemas
- Zero server management required
</TLDRBox>

Welcome to SonicJS! This guide will walk you through setting up your first edge-first headless CMS using SonicJS and Cloudflare Workers. By the end, you'll have a fully functional content API running globally with blazing-fast response times.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 20 or later** - SonicJS requires modern Node.js features
- **A Cloudflare account** - Free tier works perfectly for getting started
- **Wrangler CLI** - Cloudflare's command-line tool for Workers

```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version  # Should be v20.0.0 or higher

# Install Wrangler globally
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login
```

## Step 1: Create Your SonicJS Project

The fastest way to get started is using the create-sonicjs-app CLI:

```bash
# Create a new SonicJS project
npm create sonicjs-app my-cms

# Navigate to your project
cd my-cms
```

This scaffolds a complete SonicJS project with:

- Pre-configured Cloudflare Workers setup
- D1 database bindings
- R2 storage for media files
- KV namespace for caching
- Example content collections

## Step 2: Understand the Project Structure

Let's explore what was created:

```
my-cms/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts           # Main application entry
│   ├── collections/       # Content type definitions
│   │   ├── posts.ts
│   │   └── users.ts
│   └── plugins/           # Custom plugins
├── drizzle/
│   └── migrations/        # Database migrations
├── wrangler.toml          # Cloudflare configuration
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### The Main Entry Point

Open `src/index.ts` to see how SonicJS is configured:

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { createSonicJS } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'
import { authPlugin } from '@sonicjs-cms/core/plugins'
import { postsCollection } from './collections/posts'
import { usersCollection } from './collections/users'

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>()

// Initialize SonicJS
const cms = createSonicJS({
  collections: [postsCollection, usersCollection],
  plugins: [authPlugin()],
})

// Mount the CMS
app.route('/', cms.app)

export default app
```

## Step 3: Define Your Content Collections

Collections are the heart of SonicJS. They define your content structure with full TypeScript support.

Create a new collection in `src/collections/posts.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineCollection } from '@sonicjs-cms/core'

export const postsCollection = defineCollection({
  name: 'posts',
  slug: 'posts',
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      maxLength: 200,
    },
    slug: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      unique: true,
    },
    content: {
      type: 'richtext',
      required: true,
    },
    excerpt: {
      type: 'text',
      maxLength: 500,
    },
    featuredImage: {
      type: 'media',
    },
    author: {
      type: 'relation',
      collection: 'users',
    },
    status: {
      type: 'select',
      options: ['draft', 'published', 'archived'],
      default: 'draft',
    },
    publishedAt: {
      type: 'datetime',
    },
  },
})
```

## Step 4: Set Up Your Database

SonicJS uses Cloudflare D1, a SQLite database that runs at the edge.

### Create the D1 Database

```bash
# Create a new D1 database
wrangler d1 create my-cms-db

# You'll see output like:
# [[d1_databases]]
# binding = "DB"
# database_name = "my-cms-db"
# database_id = "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

### Update wrangler.toml

Add the database configuration to your `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
name = "my-cms"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "my-cms-db"
database_id = "your-database-id"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "CACHE"
id = "your-kv-namespace-id"

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "STORAGE"
bucket_name = "my-cms-storage"
```

### Run Migrations

Generate and run database migrations:

```bash
# Generate migrations from your collections
npm run db:generate

# Apply migrations locally
npm run db:migrate:local

# Apply migrations to production
npm run db:migrate:prod
```

## Step 5: Start Development

Launch the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your CMS is now running at `http://localhost:8787`!

### Access the Admin Panel

Open `http://localhost:8787/admin` to access the built-in admin interface. The default credentials are:

- **Email**: admin@example.com
- **Password**: admin123

> Make sure to change these credentials before deploying to production!

## Step 6: Using the Content API

SonicJS automatically generates RESTful API endpoints for your collections.

### Create Content

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/content/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My First Post",
    "slug": "my-first-post",
    "content": "<p>Hello, world!</p>",
    "status": "published"
  }'
```

### Read Content

```bash
# Get all posts
curl http://localhost:8787/api/content/posts

# Get a single post by ID
curl http://localhost:8787/api/content/posts/123

# Filter posts
curl "http://localhost:8787/api/content/posts?status=published"

# Pagination
curl "http://localhost:8787/api/content/posts?limit=10&offset=0"
```

### Update Content

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8787/api/content/posts/123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Updated Title"
  }'
```

### Delete Content

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8787/api/content/posts/123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Step 7: Deploy to Production

When you're ready to go live:

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run deploy
```

That's it! Your CMS is now live and running on Cloudflare's global network.

### Verify Your Deployment

```bash
# Test your production API
curl https://my-cms.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/content/posts
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have SonicJS running, explore these topics:

- **[Authentication](/authentication)** - Set up secure user authentication
- **[Collections](/collections)** - Learn about advanced field types and relationships
- **[Caching](/caching)** - Optimize performance with three-tiered caching
- **[Plugins](/plugins)** - Extend SonicJS with custom functionality
- **[Deployment](/deployment)** - Production deployment best practices

## Key Takeaways

- SonicJS runs on Cloudflare Workers for edge-first performance
- Collections define your content structure with TypeScript
