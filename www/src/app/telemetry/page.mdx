## What is Telemetry?

SonicJS collects **anonymous, non-identifiable telemetry data** to help us understand how the framework is being used and to improve the product. We take your privacy seriously and follow industry best practices for telemetry collection.

**Key Principles:**
- **Anonymous** - No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected
- **Transparent** - This page clearly explains what is collected
- **Optional** - You can easily opt-out at any time
- **Minimal** - We only collect what's necessary to improve the product

---

## What Data is Collected

SonicJS telemetry collects the following anonymous data during installation and usage:

### Installation Events

**Installation Success/Failure:**
- Whether the installation completed successfully
- Installation timestamp
- Installation method (npm, pnpm, yarn, etc.)

**System Information:**
- Operating system type (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Node.js version
- Package manager type and version

**Anonymous Identifiers:**
- Randomly generated installation ID (UUID)
- Project hash (one-way hash of project path, no path information is sent)

### Example Data Payload

```json
{
  "event": "installation_complete",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "installation_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "node_version": "18.17.0",
  "os": "darwin",
  "package_manager": "npm",
  "success": true
}
```

## What Data is NOT Collected

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The following data is **NEVER** collected:

- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- IP addresses or geolocation data
- File paths or directory structures
- Code or content from your projects
- Environment variables or secrets
- Database contents or connection strings
- API keys or credentials
- Custom configuration details
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

---

## How to Opt-Out

You can disable telemetry at any time using one of the following methods:

### Environment Variable (Recommended)

Set the `SONICJS_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `false`:

<CodeGroup title="Disable Telemetry">

```bash {{ title: 'Bash/Zsh' }}
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export SONICJS_TELEMETRY=false
```

```bash {{ title: 'Windows PowerShell' }}
# Add to PowerShell profile
$env:SONICJS_TELEMETRY = "false"
```

```bash {{ title: 'Windows Command Prompt' }}
# Set for current session
set SONICJS_TELEMETRY=false

# Set permanently
setx SONICJS_TELEMETRY false
```

</CodeGroup>

### Per-Project Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
SONICJS_TELEMETRY=false
```

### Verify Telemetry Status

You can verify that telemetry is disabled by checking for the telemetry notice during installation. When telemetry is disabled, you will not see the telemetry notice.

## Why We Collect Telemetry

Anonymous telemetry helps us improve SonicJS in several ways:

### Understand Installation Success

- Identify installation failures and their causes
- Improve installation experience across different environments
- Prioritize support for popular operating systems and Node.js versions

### Improve Compatibility

- Ensure SonicJS works across different Node.js versions
- Optimize for popular package managers
- Support a wide range of operating systems

### Prioritize Development

- Understand which features are most used
- Identify patterns that help guide our roadmap
- Make data-driven decisions about where to focus development efforts

### Maintain Quality

- Detect and fix issues early
- Measure the impact of changes
- Ensure a smooth experience for all users

**Important:** All insights are derived from aggregated, anonymous data. We never track individual users or projects.

---

## Data Retention

We retain anonymous telemetry data for the following periods:

**Short-term Data:**
- Raw event data: 90 days
- Used for debugging and immediate insights

**Long-term Data:**
- Aggregated statistics: Indefinitely
- Used for trend analysis and long-term planning
- All personally identifiable information removed before aggregation

**Data Deletion:**
- Individual telemetry events cannot be deleted as they are anonymous
- To stop future data collection, simply opt-out using the methods above
