## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: "Form not found" in tests

### Issue: "Builder not loading"
**Fix:** Increase timeout in test (Form.io takes 10-15 seconds to load)

### Issue: "Drag and drop not working"
**Fix:** Wait for Form.io to fully initialize before dragging

### Issue: Tests timeout
**Fix:** Check that dev server is running on port 8787
